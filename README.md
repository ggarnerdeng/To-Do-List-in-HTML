List of possible improvements:
1. User Authentication: Implement a user authentication system where users can sign up, log in, and have their own personalized to-do lists. This would involve using technologies like user registration, login/logout functionality, and secure storage of user data.

2. Task Categories or Labels: Allow users to categorize their tasks by adding labels or categories. This feature would enable better organization and filtering of tasks based on specific categories.

3. Task Reminders and Notifications: Implement reminders and notifications for tasks. Users could set reminders for specific tasks, and the application would notify them at the specified time or through other channels like email or mobile notifications.

4. Task Sharing and Collaboration: Enable task sharing and collaboration among users. This feature would allow users to share tasks with others, assign tasks to specific individuals, and track progress on shared tasks.

5. Task Prioritization and Sorting Options: Extend the sorting functionality by providing more advanced sorting options such as sorting by multiple criteria (e.g., date and priority), custom sorting orders, and dynamic sorting based on user preferences.

6. Task Scheduling and Calendar Integration: Integrate task scheduling and calendar functionality into the application. Users could schedule tasks on specific dates and have them automatically synced with their preferred calendar application.

7. Data Visualization and Analytics: Provide visual representations of task data using charts, graphs, or other data visualization techniques. This feature would allow users to gain insights into their task management patterns, productivity levels, and task completion trends.

8. Mobile App or Responsive Design: Develop a mobile application or ensure that the web application has a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This would enhance accessibility and usability for users on mobile devices.

9. Undo/Redo Functionality: Implement undo and redo functionality to allow users to revert changes made to tasks. This feature would provide an extra layer of control and flexibility when managing tasks.

10. Task History and Activity Logs: Keep track of task history and activity logs, including changes made to tasks, completion status, and timestamps. This feature would enable users to review and track their task management activities.
